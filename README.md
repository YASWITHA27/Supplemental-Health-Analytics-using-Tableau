Data analytics, Tableau Prep Builder, heuristics
Developed a two-part Tableau story leveraging data from ”The Metabolome of Food Knowledge Database.” The first
dashboard empowers pharmaceutical companies by enabling the identification of potential therapeutic compounds (Level
1 and 2) for disease mitigation, aiding in drug development. The second dashboard delves into cancer research, analyzing
the link between dietary intake and cancer pathways, providing valuable insights into the potential impact of diet on
cancer development.
